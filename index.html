                        reporting the composition of the steel being cast, which was noted down manually by
                        12 individuals per shift on a 2 feet by 2 feet sized 'HEAT LOG Sheet'.
                        The process was cumbersome and error prone, more specifically, prone to errors of omission
                        since the specificity of 118 mineral constituents of steel were logged for every batch of steel being cast.

                        The new automated technology eliminated manual intervention completely and captured the data real time with
                        the help of Korean sensors installed in the steel caster injectors to report back,
                        casting composition on a real time basis.
                        This information was captured using the ORACLE 'C' interface in the form of C data structures.
                        The captured data was stored into the central ORACLE database repository for future use
                        by Quality Assurance personnel in the form of formatted reports designed to their suitability.
